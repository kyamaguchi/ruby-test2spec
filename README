Tool for automatically converting ruby tests to ruby specs

This script works only with ruby 1.8.7.
The part of using Array should be modified.

Known issues
* Cannot convert mailer test.
* No support for assert_difference.
* Not implemented =~ -> match, !~ -> not match.
* Not implemented < etc. (Need to check be_true in generated specs.)
